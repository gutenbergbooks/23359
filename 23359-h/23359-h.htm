    <h2>
      I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of course that was not his name. Even in the State of Maine, where it is
      still a custom to maim a child for life by christening him Arioch or
      Shadrach or Ephraim, nobody would dream of calling a boy &ldquo;Quite So.&rdquo; It
      was merely a nickname which we gave him in camp; but it stuck to him with
      such bur-like tenacity, and is so inseparable from my memory of him, that
      I do not think I could write definitely of John Bladburn if I were to call
      him anything but &ldquo;Quite So.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was one night shortly after the first battle of Bull Run. The Army of
      the Potomac, shattered, stunned, and forlorn, was back in its old quarters
      behind the earthworks. The melancholy line of ambulances bearing our
      wounded to Washington was not done creeping over Long Bridge; the blue
      smocks and the gray still lay in windrows on the field of Manassas; and
      the gloom that weighed down our hearts was like the fog that stretched
      along the bosom of the Potomac, and enfolded the valley of the Shenandoah.
      A drizzling rain had set in at twilight, and, growing bolder with the
      darkness, was beating a dismal tattoo on the tent&mdash;the tent of Mess
      6, Company A, &mdash;th Regiment, N. Y. Volunteers. Our mess, consisting
      originally of eight men, was reduced to four. Little Billy, as one of the
      boys grimly remarked, had concluded to remain at Manassas; Corporal Steele
      we had to leave at Fairfax Court-House, shot through the hip; Hunter and
      Suydam we had said good-by to that afternoon. &ldquo;Tell Johnny Reb,&rdquo; says
      Hunter, lifting up the leather side-piece of the ambulance, &ldquo;that I 'll be
      back again as soon as I get a new leg.&rdquo; But Suydam said nothing; he only
      unclosed his eyes languidly and smiled farewell to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four of us who were left alive and unhurt that shameful July day sat
      gloomily smoking our brier-wood pipes, thinking our thoughts, and
      listening to the rain pattering against the canvas. That, and the
      occasional whine of a hungry cur, foraging on the outskirts of the camp
      for a stray bone, alone broke the silence, save when a vicious drop of
      rain detached itself meditatively from the ridge-pole of the tent, and
      fell upon the wick of our tallow candle, making it &ldquo;cuss,&rdquo; as Ned Strong
      described it. The candle was in the midst of one of its most profane fits
      when Blakely, knocking the ashes from his pipe and addressing no one in
      particular, but giving breath, unconsciously as it were, to the result of
      his cogitations, observed that &ldquo;it was considerable of a fizzle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The 'on to Richmond' business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what they 'll do about it over yonder,&rdquo; said Curtis, pointing
      over his right shoulder. By &ldquo;over yonder&rdquo; he meant the North in general
      and Massachusetts especially. Curtis was a Boston boy, and his sense of
      locality was so strong that, during all his wanderings in Virginia, I do
      not believe there was a moment, day or night, when he could not have made
      a bee-line for Faneuil Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do about it?&rdquo; cried Strong. &ldquo;They 'll make about two hundred thousand
      blue flannel trousers and send them along, each pair with a man in it&mdash;all
      the short men in the long trousers, and all the tall men in the short
      ones,&rdquo; he added, ruefully contemplating his own leg-gear, which scarcely
      reached to his ankles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said Blakely. &ldquo;Just now, when I was tackling the commissary
      for an extra candle, I saw a crowd of new fellows drawing blankets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say there, drop that!&rdquo; cried Strong. &ldquo;All right, sir, didn't know it
      was you,&rdquo; he added hastily, seeing it was Lieutenant Haines who had thrown
      back the flap of the tent, and let in a gust of wind and rain that
      threatened the most serious bronchial consequences to our discontented
      tallow dip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You 're to bunk in here,&rdquo; said the lieutenant, speaking to some one
      outside. The some one stepped in, and Haines vanished in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Strong had succeeded in restoring the candle to consciousness, the
      light fell upon a tall, shy-looking man of about thirty-five, with long,
      hay-colored beard and mustache, upon which the rain-drops stood in
      clusters, like the night-dew on patches of cobweb in a meadow. It was an
      honest face, with unworldly sort of blue eyes, that looked out from under
      the broad visor of the infantry cap. With a deferential glance towards us,
      the new-comer unstrapped his knapsack, spread his blanket over it, and sat
      down unobtrusively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather damp night out,&rdquo; remarked Blakely, whose strong hand was supposed
      to be conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; replied the stranger, not curtly, but pleasantly, and with an
      air as if he had said all there was to be said about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come from the North recently?&rdquo; inquired Blakely, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From any place in particular?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People considerably stirred up down there?&rdquo; continued Blakely, determined
      not to give up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blakely threw a puzzled look over the tent, and seeing Ned Strong on the
      broad grin, frowned severely. Strong instantly assumed an abstracted air,
      and began humming softly,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;I wish I was in Dixie.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The State of Maine,&rdquo; observed Blakely, with a certain defiance of manner
      not at all necessary in discussing a geographical question, &ldquo;is a pleasant
      State.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In summer,&rdquo; suggested the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In summer, I mean,&rdquo; returned Blakely with animation, thinking he had
      broken the ice. &ldquo;Cold as blazes in winter, though&mdash;Isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The new recruit merely nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blakely eyed the man homicidally for a moment, and then, smiling one of
      those smiles of simulated gayety which the novelists inform us are more
      tragic than tears, turned upon him with withering irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust you left the old folks pretty comfortable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old folks dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blakely made a sudden dive for his blanket, tucked it around him with
      painful precision, and was heard no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then the bugle sounded &ldquo;lights out,&rdquo;&mdash;bugle answering bugle in
      far-off camps. When our not elaborate night-toilets were complete, Strong
      threw somebody else's old boot at the candle with infallible aim, and
      darkness took possession of the tent. Ned, who lay on my left, presently
      reached over to me, and whispered, &ldquo;I say, our friend 'quite so' is a
      garrulous old boy! He'll talk himself to death some of these odd times, if
      he is n't careful. How he <i>did</i> run on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, when I opened my eyes, the new member of Mess 6 was
      sitting on his knapsack, combing his blonde beard with a horn comb. He
      nodded pleasantly to me, and to each of the boys as they woke up, one by
      one. Blakely did not appear disposed to renew the animated conversation of
      the previous night; but while he was gone to make a requisition for what
      was in pure sarcasm called coffee, Curtis ventured to ask the man his
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bladburn, John,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's rather an unwieldy name for every-day use,&rdquo; put in Strong. &ldquo;If it
      would n't hurt your feelings, I 'd like to call you Quite So&mdash;for
      short. Don't say no, if you don't like it. Is it agreeable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bladburn gave a little laugh, all to himself, seemingly, and was about to
      say, &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; when he caught at the words, blushed like a girl, and
      nodded a sunny assent to Strong. From that day until the end, the
      sobriquet clung to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disaster at Bull Bun was followed, as the reader knows, by a long
      period of masterly inactivity, so far as the Army of the Potomac was
      concerned. McDowell, a good soldier, but unlucky, retired to Arlington
      Heights, and McClellan, who had distinguished himself in Western Virginia,
      took command of the forces in front of Washington, and bent his energies
      to reorganizing the demoralized troops. It was a dreary time to the people
      of the North, who looked fatuously from week to week for &ldquo;the fall of
      Richmond;&rdquo; and it was a dreary time to the denizens of that vast city of
      tents and forts which stretched in a semicircle before the beleaguered
      Capitol&mdash;so tedious and soul-wearing a time that the hardships of
      forced marches and the horrors of battle became desirable things to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roll-call morning and evening, guard-duty, dress-parades, an occasional
      reconnoissance, dominoes, wrestling-matches, and such rude games as could
      be carried on in camp made up the sum of our lives. The arrival of the
      mail with letters and papers from home was the event of the day. We
      noticed that Bladburn neither wrote nor received any letters. When the
      rest of the boys were scribbling away for dear life, with drum-heads and
      knapsacks and cracker-boxes for writing-desks, he would sit serenely
      smoking his pipe, but looking out on us through rings of smoke with a face
      expressive of the tenderest interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Quite So,&rdquo; Strong would say, &ldquo;the mail-bag closes in half an
      hour. Ain't you going to write?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe not to-day,&rdquo; Bladburn would reply, as if he had written
      yesterday, or would write to-morrow: but he never wrote.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had become a great favorite with us, and with all the officers of the
      regiment. He talked less than any man I ever knew, but there was nothing
      sinister or sullen in his reticence. It was sunshine,&mdash;warmth and
      brightness, but no voice. Unassuming and modest to the verge of shyness,
      he impressed every one as a man of singular pluck and nerve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Curtis to me one day, &ldquo;that that fellow Quite So is
      clear grit, and when we come to close quarters with our Palmetto brethren
      over yonder, he'll do something devilish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, nothing quite explainable; the exasperating coolness of the man, as
      much as anything. This morning the boys were teasing Muffin Fan [a small
      mulatto girl who used to bring muffins into camp three times a week,&mdash;at
      the peril of her life!] and Jemmy Blunt of Company K&mdash;you know him&mdash;was
      rather rough on the girl, when Quite So, who had been reading under a
      tree, shut one finger in his book, walked over to where the boys were
      skylarking, and with the smile of a juvenile angel on his face lifted
      Jemmy out of that and set him down gently in front of his own tent. There
      Blunt sat speechless, staring at Quite So, who was back again under the
      tree, pegging away at his little Latin grammar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That Latin grammar! He always had it about him, reading it or turning over
      its dog's-eared pages at odd intervals and in out-of-the-way places. Half
      a dozen times a day he would draw it out from the bosom of his blouse,
      which had taken the shape of the book just over the left breast, look at
      it as if to assure himself it was all right, and then put the thing back.
      At night the volume lay beneath his pillow. The first thing in the
      morning, before he was well awake, his hand would go groping instinctively
      under his knapsack in search of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A devastating curiosity seized upon us boys concerning that Latin grammar,
      for we had discovered the nature of the book. Strong wanted to steal it
      one night, but concluded not to. &ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; reflected Strong,
      &ldquo;I haven't the heart to do it, and in the next place I have n't the moral
      courage. Quite So would placidly break every bone in my body.&rdquo; And I
      believe Strong was not far out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes I was vexed with myself for allowing this tall, simple-hearted
      country fellow to puzzle me so much. And yet, was he a simple-hearted
      country fellow? City bred he certainly was not; but his manner, in spite
      of his awkwardness, had an indescribable air of refinement. Now and then,
      too, he dropped a word or a phrase that showed his familiarity with
      unexpected lines of reading. &ldquo;The other day,&rdquo; said Curtis, with the
      slightest elevation of eyebrow, &ldquo;he had the cheek to correct my Latin for
      me.&rdquo; In short, Quite So was a daily problem to the members of Mess 6.
      Whenever he was absent, and Blakely and Curtis and Strong and I got
      together in the tent, we discussed him, evolving various theories to
      explain why he never wrote to anybody and why nobody ever wrote to him.
      Had the man committed some terrible crime, and fled to the army to hide
      his guilt? Blakely suggested that he must have murdered &ldquo;the old folks.&rdquo;
       What did he mean by eternally conning that tattered Latin grammar? And was
      his name Bladburn, anyhow? Even his imperturbable amiability became
      suspicious. And then his frightful reticence! If he was the victim of any
      deep grief or crushing calamity, why did n't he seem unhappy? What
      business had he to be cheerful?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's my opinion,&rdquo; said Strong, &ldquo;that he 's a rival Wandering Jew; the
      original Jacobs, you know, was a dark fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blakely inferred from something Bladburn had said, or something he had not
      said&mdash;which was more likely&mdash;that he had been a schoolmaster at
      some period of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Schoolmaster be hanged!&rdquo; was Strong's comment. &ldquo;Can you fancy a
      schoolmaster going about conjugating baby verbs out of a dratted little
      spelling-book? No, Quite So has evidently been a&mdash;a&mdash;Blest if I
      can imagine <i>what</i> he 's been!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whatever John Bladburn had been, he was a lonely man. Whenever I want a
      type of perfect human isolation, I shall think of him, as he was in those
      days, moving remote, self-contained, and alone in the midst of two hundred
      thousand men.

    <h2>
      II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Indian summer, with its infinite beauty and tenderness, came like a
      reproach that year to Virginia. The foliage, touched here and there with
      prismatic tints, drooped motionless in the golden haze. The delicate
      Virginia creeper was almost minded to put forth its scarlet buds again. No
      wonder the lovely phantom&mdash;this dusky Southern sister of the pale
      Northern June&mdash;lingered not long with us, but, filling the once
      peaceful glens and valleys with her pathos, stole away rebukefully before
      the savage enginery of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preparations that had been going on for months in arsenals and
      foundries at the North were nearly completed. For weeks past the air had
      been filled with rumors of an advance; but the rumor of to-day refuted the
      rumor of yesterday, and the Grand Army did not move. Heintzelman's corps
      was constantly folding its tents, like the Arabs, and as silently stealing
      away; but somehow it was always in the same place the next morning. One
      day, at last, orders came down for our brigade to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We 're going to Richmond, boys!&rdquo; shouted Strong, thrusting his head in at
      the tent; and we all cheered and waved our caps like mad. You see, Big
      Bethel and Bull Run and Ball's Bluff (the bloody B's, as we used to call
      them) had n't taught us any better sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising abruptly from the plateau, to the left of our encampment, was a
      tall hill covered with a stunted growth of red-oak, persimmon, and
      chestnut. The night before we struck tents I climbed up to the crest to
      take a parting look at a spectacle which custom had not been able to rob
      of its enchantment. There, at my feet, and extending miles and miles away,
      lay the camps of the Grand Army, with its camp-fires reflected luridly
      against the sky. Thousands of lights were twinkling in every direction,
      some nestling in the valley, some like fire-flies beating their wings and
      palpitating among the trees, and others stretching in parallel lines and
      curves, like the street-lamps of a city. Somewhere, far off, a band was
      playing, at intervals it seemed; and now and then, nearer to, a silvery
      strain from a bugle shot sharply up through the night, and seemed to lose
      itself like a rocket among the stars&mdash;the patient, untroubled stars.
      Suddenly a hand was laid upon my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'd like to say a word to you,&rdquo; said Bladburn.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a little start of surprise, I made room for him on the fallen tree
      where I was seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may n't get another chance,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You and the boys have been very
      kind to me, kinder than I deserve; but sometimes I 've fancied that my not
      saying anything about myself had given you the idea that all was not right
      in my past. I want to say that I came down to Virginia with a clean
      record.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We never really doubted it, Bladburn.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;If I did n't write home,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;it was because I had n't any
      home, neither kith nor kin. When I said the old folks were dead, I said
      it. Am I boring you? If I thought I was&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Bladburn. I have often wanted you to talk to me about yourself, not
      from idle curiosity, I trust, but because I liked you that rainy night
      when you came to camp, and have gone on liking you ever since. This is n't
      too much to say, when Heaven only knows how soon I may be past saying it
      or you listening to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it,&rdquo; said Bladburn, hurriedly, &ldquo;that's why I want to talk with
      you. I 've a fancy that I sha' n't come out of our first battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words gave me a queer start, for I had been trying several days to
      throw off a similar presentiment concerning him&mdash;a foolish
      presentiment that grew out of a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In case anything of that kind turns up,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I 'd like you to
      have my Latin grammar here&mdash;you 've seen me reading it. You might
      stick it away in a bookcase, for the sake of old times. It goes against me
      to think of it falling into rough hands or being kicked about camp and
      trampled underfoot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was drumming softly with his fingers on the volume in the bosom of his
      blouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n't intend to speak of this to a living soul,&rdquo; he went on,
      motioning me not to answer him; &ldquo;but something took hold of me to-night
      and made me follow you up here, Perhaps if I told you all, you would be
      the more willing to look after the little book in case it goes ill with
      me. When the war broke out I was teaching school down in Maine, in the
      same village where my father was schoolmaster before me. The old man when
      he died left me quite alone. I lived pretty much by myself, having no
      interests outside of the district school, which seemed in a manner my
      personal property. Eight years ago last spring a new pupil was brought to
      the school, a slight slip of a girl, with a sad kind of face and quiet
      ways. Perhaps it was because she was n't very strong, and perhaps because
      she was n't used over well by those who had charge of her, or perhaps it
      was because my life was lonely, that my heart warmed to the child. It all
      seems like a dream now, since that April morning when little Mary stood in
      front of my desk with her pretty eyes looking down bashfully and her soft
      hair falling over her face. One day I look up, and six years have gone by&mdash;as
      they go by in dreams&mdash;and among the scholars is a tall girl of
      sixteen, with serious, womanly eyes which I cannot trust myself to look
      upon. The old life has come to an end. The child has become a woman and
      can teach the master now. So help me Heaven, I did n't know that I loved
      her until that day!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long after the children had gone home I sat in the school-room with my
      face resting on my hands. There was her desk, the afternoon shadows
      falling across it. It never looked empty and cheerless before. I went and
      stood by the low chair, as I had stood hundreds of times. On the desk was
      a pile of books, ready to be taken away, and among the rest a small Latin
      grammar which we had studied together. What little despairs and triumphs
      and happy hours were associated with it! I took it up curiously, as if it
      were some gentle dead thing, and turned over the pages, and could hardly
      see them. Turning the pages, idly so, I came to a leaf on which something
      was written with ink, in the familiar girlish hand. It was only the words
      'Dear John,' through which she had drawn two hasty pencil lines&mdash;I
      wish she had n't drawn those lines!&rdquo; added Bladburn, under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a minute or two, looking off towards the camps, where
      the lights were fading out one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no right to go and love Mary. I was twice her age, an awkward,
      unsocial man, that would have blighted her youth. I was as wrong as wrong
      can be. But I never meant to tell her. I locked the grammar in my desk and
      the secret in my heart for a year. I could n't bear to meet her in the
      village, and kept away from every place where she was likely to be. Then
      she came to me, and sat down at my feet penitently, just as she used to do
      when she was a child, and asked what she had done to anger me; and then,
      Heaven forgive me! I told her all, and asked her if she could say with her
      lips the words she had written, and she nestled in my arms all a-trembling
      like a bird, and said them over and over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Mary's family heard of our engagement, there was trouble. They
      looked higher for Mary than a middle-aged schoolmaster. No blame to them.
      They forbade me the house, her uncles; but we met in the village and at
      the neighbors' houses, and I was happy, knowing she loved me. Matters were
      in this state when the war came on. I had a strong call to look after the
      old flag, and I hung my head that day when the company raised in our
      village marched by the school-house to the railroad station; but I
      couldn't tear myself away. About this time the minister's son, who had
      been away to college, came to the village. He met Mary here and there, and
      they became great friends. He was a likely fellow, near her own age, and
      it was natural they should like one another. Sometimes I winced at seeing
      him made free of the home from which I was shut out; then I would open the
      grammar at the leaf where 'Dear John' was written up in the corner, and my
      trouble was gone. Mary was sorrowful and pale these days, and I think her
      people were worrying her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was one evening two or three days before we got the news of Bull Run.
      I had gone down to the burying-ground to trim the spruce hedge set round
      the old man's lot, and was just stepping into the enclosure, when I heard
      voices from the opposite side. One was Mary's, and the other I knew to be
      young Marston's, the minister's son. I did n't mean to listen, but what
      Mary was saying struck me dumb. <i>We must never meet again</i>, she was
      saying in a wild way. <i>We must say good-by here, for ever,&mdash;good-by,
      good-by!</i> And I could hear her sobbing. Then, presently, she said,
      hurriedly, <i>No, no; my hand, not my lips!</i> Then it seemed he kissed
      her hands, and the two parted, one going towards the parsonage, and the
      other out by the gate near where I stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how long I stood there, but the night-dews had wet me to the
      bone when I stole out of the graveyard and across the road to the
      school-house. I unlocked the door, and took the Latin grammar from the
      desk and hid it in my bosom. There was not a sound or a light anywhere as
      I walked out of the village. And now,&rdquo; said Bladburn, rising suddenly from
      the tree-trunk, &ldquo;if the little book ever falls in your way, won't you see
      that it comes to no harm, for my sake, and for the sake of the little
      woman who was true to me and did n't love me? Wherever she is to-night,
      God bless her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As we descended to camp with our arms resting on each other's shoulder,
      the watch-fires were burning low in the valleys and along the hillsides,
      and as far as the eye could reach the silent tents lay bleaching in the
      moonlight.

    <h2>
      III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We imagined that the throwing forward of our brigade was the initial
      movement of a general advance of the army; but that, as the reader will
      remember, did not take place until the following March. The Confederates
      had fallen back to Centreville without firing a shot, and the national
      troops were in possession of Lewinsville, Vienna, and Fairfax Court-House.
      Our new position was nearly identical with that which we had occupied on
      the night previous to the battle of Bull Run&mdash;on the old turnpike
      road to Manassas, where the enemy was supposed to be in great force. With
      a field-glass we could see the Rebel pickets moving in a belt of woodland
      on our right, and morning and evening we heard the spiteful roll of their
      snare-drums.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those pickets soon became a nuisance to us. Hardly a night passed but they
      fired upon our outposts, so far with no harmful result; but after a while
      it grew to be a serious matter. The Rebels would crawl out on all-fours
      from the wood into a field covered with underbrush, and lie there in the
      dark for hours, waiting for a shot. Then our men took to the rifle-pits&mdash;pits
      ten or twelve feet long by four or five deep, with the loose earth banked
      up a few inches high on the exposed sides. All the pits bore names, more
      or less felicitous, by which they were known to their transient tenants.
      One was called &ldquo;The Pepper-Box,&rdquo; another &ldquo;Uncle Sam's Well,&rdquo; another &ldquo;The
      Reb-Trap,&rdquo; and another, I am constrained to say, was named after a
      not-to-be-mentioned tropical locality. Though this rude sort of
      nomenclature predominated, there was no lack of softer titles, such as
      &ldquo;Fortress Matilda&rdquo; and &ldquo;Castle Mary,&rdquo; and one had, though unintentionally,
      a literary flavor to it, &ldquo;Blair's Grave,&rdquo; which was not popularly
      considered as reflecting unpleasantly on Nat Blair, who had assisted in
      making the excavation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the regiment had discovered a field of late corn in the
      neighborhood, and used to boil a few ears every day, while it lasted, for
      the boys detailed on the night-picket. The corn-cobs were always
      scrupulously preserved and mounted on the parapets of the pits. Whenever a
      Rebel shot carried away one of these <i>barbette</i> guns, there was
      swearing in that particular trench. Strong, who was very sensitive to this
      kind of disaster, was complaining bitterly one morning, because he had
      lost three &ldquo;pieces&rdquo; the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's Quite So, now,&rdquo; said Strong, &ldquo;when a Minie-ball comes <i>ping!</i>
      and knocks one of his guns to flinders, he merely smiles, and does n't at
      all see the degradation of the thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Bladburn! As I watched him day by day going about his duties, in his
      shy, cheery way, with a smile for every one and not an extra word for
      anybody, it was hard to believe he was the same man who, that night before
      we broke camp by the Potomac, had poured out to me the story of his love
      and sorrow in words that burned in my memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Strong was speaking, Blakely lifted aside the flap of the tent and
      looked in on us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys, Quite So was hurt last night,&rdquo; he said, with a white tremor to his
      lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shot on picket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he was in the pit next to mine,&rdquo; cried Strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Badly hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Badly hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew he was; I need not have asked the question. He never meant to go
      back to New England!
    </p>
    <p>
      Bladburn was lying on the stretcher in the hospital-tent The surgeon had
      knelt down by him, and was carefully cutting away the bosom of his blouse.
      The Latin grammar, stained and torn, slipped, and fell to the floor.
      Bladburn gave me a quick glance. I picked up the book, and as I placed it
      in his hand, the icy fingers closed softly over mine. He was sinking fast.
      In a few minutes the surgeon finished his examination. When he rose to his
      feet there were tears on the weather-beaten cheeks. He was a rough
      outside, but a tender heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor lad,&rdquo; he blurted out, &ldquo;it's no use. If you 've anything to say,
      say it now, for you 've nearly done with this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Bladburn lifted his eyes slowly to the surgeon, and the old smile
      flitted over his face as he murmured,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so.&rdquo;
